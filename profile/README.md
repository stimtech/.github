STIM is a non-profit member organisation tasked with ensuring that its more than 100,000 affiliated rightsholders and music publishers get paid when their music is used. We provide the conditions for creativity and regrowth in the Swedish music industry. It’s why STIM strives to ensure that there are strong copyright laws in place. Which is exactly what we’ve always done, since 1923.
